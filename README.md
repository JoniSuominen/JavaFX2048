# JavaFX2048

Attempt at JavaFX 2048.

Creating a JavaFX-version of the game was a small idea which occured after completing the Finnish Java 
MOOC-course by University of Helsinki. We had made a text-based copy of the game in Java and thus I got
interested in making the graphical version as well.

The game wasn't a serious problem but it introduced me to lots of different JavaFX-features. The game is currently unfinished and on-hold but I figured its worth it to save. I have written a few TODOs below if I ever start working on this so I know what to work on :).

TODO:

1. Fix bug which occurs while doing merges sometimes where the merging tile stays enlarged
and doesnt resize back to normal until it merges again.

2. Refractor the code (Currently under work on a seperate branch).
