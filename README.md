# JavaFX2048

JavaFX-version of the popular 2048 game.

Creating a JavaFX-version of the game was a small idea which occured after completing the Finnish Java 
MOOC-course by University of Helsinki. We had made a text-based copy of the game in Java and thus I got
interested in making the graphical version as well.

TODO:

1. Fix bug which occurs while doing merges sometimes where the merging tile stays enlarged
and doesnt resize back to normal until it merges again.

2. Refractor the code (Currently under work on a seperate branch).
